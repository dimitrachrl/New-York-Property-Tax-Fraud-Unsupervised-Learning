# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (Fraud) Algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm, specifically designed for identifying fraud or unusual patterns within a dataset. The algorithm performs a forensic-type analysis with a focus on detecting anomalies in property valuations. The process involves data cleaning, variable creation, dimensionality reduction, and two different anomaly detection methods.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Property-Valuation-and-Assessment-Data/rgy2-tti8).

## Files
- `NY unsupervised models.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm.
- `Fraud Final Report.pdf`: A report analyzing the process, findings and results of the anomaly detection algorithm.
